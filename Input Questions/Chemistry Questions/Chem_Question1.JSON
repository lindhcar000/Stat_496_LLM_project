  "Question" : "For the reaction: H2O (g) + CO (g) <-> H2 (g) + CO2 (g) consider an experiment where equal numbers of moles H2O, CO, CO2, and H2 are injected into a rigid, sealed reaction vessel and heated to 500K. If Kc = 24 at 500 K, which of the following correctly describes the composition of the equilibrium mixture?
a) [H20] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2]
b) [H20] = [CO] < [H2] = [CO2]
c) [H20] = [CO] > [H2] = [CO2]",
  "Answer" : "b"
