  "Question": "Researchers are evaluating whether using a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention smartphone application is associated with the risk of acquiring an STI over a 12-month period. The application includes features such as daily PrEP reminders, risk-reduction tips, and local STI testing site locators. However, early data suggest that people who choose to download the application may differ in important ways from those who do not. For instance, those with a higher number of sexual partners may be more likely to download the application because they might perceive themselves to be at greater risk for STIs. Since having more partners is also strongly associated with STI acquisition, this variable may be important in understanding the relationship between application use and STI risk.\n\nBelow are the study results.\n\nCRUDE (UNSTRATIFIED) DATA:\n- App use: STI = 268, No STI = 732\n- No app use: STI = 65, No STI = 935\n\nSTRATIFIED BY NUMBER OF SEXUAL PARTNERS:\n\nStratum: 0–2 partners\n- App use: STI = 7, No STI = 93\n- No app use: STI = 45, No STI = 855\n\nStratum: 3+ partners\n- App use: STI = 261, No STI = 639\n- No app use: STI = 20, No STI = 80\n\nUse this information to answer questions 4–7. Assess for confounding and effect modification and make sure to indicate your final determination. Based on your determination, provide the measure of association that best represents the relationship in this population and offer an interpretation.",
  "Answer": "Adjusted RR = 1.44"
