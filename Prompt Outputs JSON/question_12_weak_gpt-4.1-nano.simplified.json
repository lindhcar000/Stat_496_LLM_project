      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Certainly. If a sequence is bounded and diverges, it cannot have all subsequences converging to the same limit, because divergence implies not all subsequences converge to a single point. However, divergence of a bounded sequence typically involves the existence of at least two subsequences converging to different limits, such as oscillating sequences."

      "role": "assistant",
