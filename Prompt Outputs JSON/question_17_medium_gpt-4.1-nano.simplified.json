  "question": "Researchers are evaluating whether using a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention smartphone application is associated with the risk of acquiring an STI over a 12-month period. The application includes features such as daily PrEP reminders, risk-reduction tips, and local STI testing site locators. However, early data suggest that people who choose to download the application may differ in important ways from those who do not. For instance, those with a higher number of sexual partners may be more likely to download the application because they might perceive themselves to be at greater risk for STIs. Since having more partners is also strongly associated with STI acquisition, this variable may be important in understanding the relationship between application use and STI risk.\n\nBelow are the study results.\n\nCRUDE (UNSTRATIFIED) DATA:\n- App use: STI = 268, No STI = 732\n- No app use: STI = 65, No STI = 935\n\nSTRATIFIED BY NUMBER OF SEXUAL PARTNERS:\n\nStratum: 0–2 partners\n- App use: STI = 7, No STI = 93\n- No app use: STI = 45, No STI = 855\n\nStratum: 3+ partners\n- App use: STI = 261, No STI = 639\n- No app use: STI = 20, No STI = 80\n\nUse this information to answer questions 4–7. Assess for confounding and effect modification and make sure to indicate your final determination. Based on your determination, provide the measure of association that best represents the relationship in this population and offer an interpretation.",

      "content": "The crude data shows a higher STI rate among app users, but stratified data reveals that among those with 3+ partners, app users have a much higher STI rate, indicating effect modification. The association between app use and STI risk varies by the number of partners, suggesting effect modification rather than confounding. Since the stratified analysis shows different associations across strata, the best measure is the stratum-specific odds ratio for the 3+ partners group, which indicates a strong positive association in this subgroup."

The strongest association appears in the overall crude data, but stratified analysis shows the association varies by number of partners.\n\nTherefore, the best measure is the stratum-specific OR in the 3+ partners group, which indicates a weaker but still positive association, confirming effect modification."
