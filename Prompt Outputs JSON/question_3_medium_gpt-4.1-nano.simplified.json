  "question": "A scientist has obtained two random samples: X_1, X_2, ..., X_n ~ Exp(theta) where each measurement are independent of the others, independently of $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_m ~ Exp(k *theta), where (theta >= 0) is the (unknown) mean of the distribution and k is some known positive number and where each measurment is independent of the others. We want to find the estimator which is a weighted average of the two estimators. $T_1 = a * hat{theta_1} + (1-a) * hat{theta_2}$ where the constant a($0 <= a <= 1$) is chosen to minimize Var($T_1$). Find a. Output your answer in one fraction in the format (Numerator)/(Denominator).",
