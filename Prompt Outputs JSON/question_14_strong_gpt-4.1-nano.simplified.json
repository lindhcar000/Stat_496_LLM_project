For example, a sequence that is 1 for all terms beyond some point and has finitely many terms not equal to 1 can have infinitely many ones and still converge to 1. But if the sequence has infinitely many ones and the other terms do not approach 1, it cannot converge to a limit different from 1."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "A sequence with infinitely many ones can converge to a limit not equal to one if the sequence oscillates or diverges, but for convergence, the terms must approach a single value. Having infinitely many ones does not prevent convergence to a limit different from one if the sequence is not converging. However, if the sequence converges, the limit must be the value it approaches, which cannot be different from 1 if infinitely many terms are 1 and the sequence converges to a limit."
