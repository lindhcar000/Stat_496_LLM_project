  "question": "The number of injury claims per month is modeled by a random variable N with P [ N=n] = 1/(n+1)(n+2), for nonnegative integers, n. Calculate the probability of at least one claim during a particular month, given that there have been at most four claims during that month. The final answer should be a decimal point rounded to the nearest tenth.",
