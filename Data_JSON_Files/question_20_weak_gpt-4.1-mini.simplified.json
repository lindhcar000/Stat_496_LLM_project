For the soy milk and cancer data, calculate the risk ratio (relative risk):\n\n- Risk in soy milk drinkers = 2 / (2 + 498) = 2 / 500 = 0.004\n- Risk in non-soy milk drinkers = 5 / (5 + 496268) ≈ 5 / 496273 ≈ 0.0000101\n\nRisk ratio = 0.004 / 0.0000101 ≈ 396\n\nFor the app use and STI data, calculate the risk ratio:\n\n- Risk in no app use = 65 / (65 + 935) = 65 / 1000 = 0.065\n- Risk in app use (assuming the 732 is app users with no STI, but no STI count for app users is missing, so cannot calculate)\n\nSince the question asks for the appropriate measure of association for the first 5 years of the study and the soy milk data is more complete, the relative risk for cancer in soy milk drinkers vs non-drinkers is approximately 396."
