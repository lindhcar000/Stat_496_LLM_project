  "question": "Cervical cancer is more common (higher prevalence) among Black women than white women. Using the same Pap smear screening test (sensitivity and specificity 97% and 98% respectively), which of the following would you expect?. a. The positive predictive value of the Pap smear screening test is higher in white women than Black women. b. The positive predictive value of the Pap smear screening test is higher in Black women than white women. c. The positive predictive value of the Pap smear screening test is the same in white and Black women. d. The positive predictive value of the Pap smear screening test is unrelated to the underlying prevalence",
