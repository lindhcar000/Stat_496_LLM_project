      "content": "Let's carefully reconsider:\n\nA sequence converges to \\(L\\) if all terms eventually get arbitrarily close to \\(L\\). If there are infinitely many terms equal to 1, these terms form a subsequence constantly equal to 1, which converges to 1. Since the whole sequence converges, all subsequences must converge to the same limit. Therefore, the limit must be 1.\n\nSo, no sequence with infinitely many ones can converge to a limit different from 1."
