      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, I can verify it. For a Rate Ratio, significance is determined by whether the confidence interval includes 1. Since 1 lies between 0.33 and 5.21, the null hypothesis (no effect) cannot be rejected. Therefore, the result is not statistically significant."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For a Rate Ratio, if the 95% confidence interval includes 1, the result is not statistically significant because 1 indicates no difference in rates. Since the interval 0.33 to 5.21 includes 1, the result is not significant."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The confidence interval for the Rate Ratio is 0.33 to 5.21. Since this interval includes 1, it means the Rate Ratio could be equal to 1 (no effect). Therefore, the result is not statistically significant."

      "content": "A confidence interval for a Rate Ratio that spans from 0.33 to 5.21 is very wide and includes 1. Since 1 is within the interval, it means the Rate Ratio could indicate no effect. Thus, the result is not statistically significant."
