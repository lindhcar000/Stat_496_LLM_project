  "Response1": "Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here about equilibrium concentrations. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe reaction given is H2O(g) + Cl2O(g) \u21cc 2 HOCl(g). The initial concentrations are [H2O] = 0.00732 M and [Cl2O] = 0.00732 M, with no HOCl present initially. I need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all three substances.\n\nFirst, I remember that at equilibrium, the reaction quotient Q is equal to the equilibrium constant K when the system has reached equilibrium. So, maybe I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to track the changes in each species' concentration as they approach equilibrium from the initial state.\n\nLet me write down what's given:\n\n- Initial concentrations:\n  [H2O] = 0.00732 M\n  [Cl2O] = 0.00732 M\n  [HOCl] = 0\n\nI need to let x be the change in concentration as the reaction proceeds towards equilibrium. Since HOCl is a product, its concentration will increase by 2x (because the stoichiometric coefficient is 2). Meanwhile, H2O and Cl2O concentrations will decrease by x each.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n[H2O] = 0.00732 - x\n[Cl2O] = 0.00732 - x\n[HOCl] = 0 + 2x\n\nNow, the expression for K is:\n\nK = ([HOCl]^2) / ([H2O][Cl2O])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations into this equation should give me an equation to solve for x.\n\nSo,\n\n( (2x)^2 ) / [ (0.00732 - x)(0.00732 - x) ] = 4.8e-3\n\nSimplifying numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 4x\u00b2\nDenominator: (0.00732 - x)^2\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n4x\u00b2 / (0.00732 - x)^2 = 4.8e-3\n\nHmm, maybe I can take square roots on both sides to simplify this.\n\nTaking square root of both sides gives:\n\n(2x) / (0.00732 - x) )= sqrt(4.8e-3)\n\nCalculating the right side:",

  "Response4": "Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium concentrations. Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe reaction given is H2O(g) + Cl2O(g) \u21cc 2 HOCl(g). The initial concentrations are [H2O] = 0.00732 M and [Cl2O] = 0.00732 M, with no HOCl present initially. I need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all three substances.\n\nFirst off, since both H2O and Cl2O start at the same concentration and there's nothing else present, this looks like a problem where they react completely or partially according to the stoichiometry until an equilibrium is reached.\n\nLet me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for clarity. \n\n- Initial concentrations:\n  - H2O: 0.00732 M\n  - Cl2O: 0.00732 M\n  - HOCl: 0\n\nChange will be based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. For every mole of H2O and Cl2O that reacts, it produces 2 moles of HOCl.\n\nLet me let 'x' represent the change in concentration for both H2O and Cl2O as they react to form HOCl. So:\n\n- Change:\n  - H2O: -x\n  - Cl2O: -x\n  - HOCl: +2x\n\nThis means at equilibrium, the concentrations will be:\n\n- [H2O] = 0.00732 - x\n- [Cl2O] = 0.00732 - x\n- [HOCl] = 0 + 2x = 2x\n\nNow, since we're dealing with an equilibrium, I can use the expression for K to set up the equation.\n\nThe reaction is H2O(g) + Cl2O(g) \u21cc 2 HOCl(g), so the K expression will be:\n\nK = ([HOCl]^2) / ([H2O][Cl2O])\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations into this equation gives:\n\nK = (2x)^2 / [(0.00732 - x)(0.00732 - x)]\n\nSimplify that denominator: it's just (0.00732 - x)^2.\n\nSo, K = 4x^2 / (0.00732 - x)^2\n\nWait a second",

The initial concentrations are [H2O] = 0.00732 M and [Cl2O] = 0.00732 M, with no HOCl present.\n\nFirst, I'll set up an ICE table to track the changes in concentration as the system approaches equilibrium.\n\nInitial:\n[H2O] = 0.00732\n[Cl2O] = 0.00732\n[HOCl] = 0\n\nChange: Let's let x be the amount of H2O and Cl2O that reacts, producing 2x HOCl.\nSo,\n[H2O] decreases by x \u2192 0.00732 - x\n[Cl2O] also decreases by x \u2192 0.00732 - x\n[HOCl] increases by 2x \u2192 0 + 2x\n\nEquilibrium:\n[H2O] = 0.00732 - x\n[Cl2O] = 0.00732 - x\n[HOCl] = 2x\n\nNow, the expression for K is given as 4.8 \u00d710^3.\n\nSo, K = ([HOCl]^2) / ([H2O][Cl2O]) = (2x)^2 / [(0.00732 - x)(0.00732 - x)] \n\nSimplify denominator: (0.00732 - x)^2\n\nThus,\nK = 4*(x^2) / (0.00732 - x)^2 = 4.8e3\n\nHmm, this looks a bit tricky because both numerator and denominator have squares of similar terms. Maybe I can let y = x/(0.00732). Let me see.\n\nLet\u2019s set y = x / 0.00732 \u2192 x = 0.00732 * y\n\nSubstituting into K expression:\n4*( (0.00732*y)^2 ) / (0.00732 - 0.00732y)^2 = 4.8e3\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 4 * (0.00732^2) * y\u00b2\nDenominator: (0.00732(1 - y))^2 \u2192 0.00732\u00b2*(1 - y)^2\n\nSo, K"
