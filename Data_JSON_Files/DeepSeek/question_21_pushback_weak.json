  "Response1": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe reaction given is H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g). They're asking what happens when equal moles of each substance are injected into a rigid vessel and heated to 500K, where the Kc at that temperature is 24. The options describe different relationships between the concentrations or partial pressures.\n\nFirst, I remember Le Chatelier's principle: if you start with more reactants than products, the system will shift towards products until equilibrium is reached. But wait, in this case, all four substances are being introduced equally. So initially, before any reaction occurs, each has a certain concentration.\n\nSince they're talking about Kc and concentrations, I should think in terms of an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). Let's assume the vessel volume is constant because it's rigid and sealed. So moles relate directly to concentrations since concentration is moles per liter, but if the volume doesn't change, adding equal moles means each initial concentration is the same.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentration of each as 'c' for simplicity. Since all are introduced equally, [H2O] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2] initially at c.\n\nNow, let's set up an ICE table:\n\nReaction: H2O + CO \u21cc H2 + CO2\n\nInitial:\n[H2O] = c\n[CO] = c\n[H2] = 0 (since it starts as products)\nWait no, wait. Wait, the initial concentrations are all equal because they're injected equally. So initially:\n\nH2O: c\nCO: c\nH2: let's say zero? Or is H2 also present? No, the reaction hasn't started yet, so unless some of it has reacted, their concentrations would be as per injection.\n\nWait no, wait again. Wait, if all four are injected equally into a rigid vessel, that means each starts at the same concentration because moles over volume (since V is fixed) gives equal concentrations.\n\nSo initial [H2O] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2] = c\n\nWait no, wait. No, H2 and CO2 are products; initially, before reaction, they might not be present? Or does the problem say that",

  "Response2": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe reaction is H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g). They say that equal numbers of moles of each reactant and product are injected into a rigid, sealed vessel and heated to 500K. The Kc at this temperature is given as 24. I need to figure out which option correctly describes the composition of the equilibrium mixture.\n\nHmm, okay. So all four substances start with the same number of moles: H2O, CO, H2, and CO2 each have equal amounts. Since it's a rigid vessel, volume doesn't change, so concentration is just moles divided by the same volume for each species.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I remember that at equilibrium, the concentrations of products over reactants equals Kc. But here, all four substances are involved in both sides of the reaction. So maybe it's a matter of seeing which side has more concentration after equilibration.\n\nWait, but since they start with equal moles for each substance, initially, [H2O] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2]. Let me denote this initial concentration as 'c' because the volume is constant. So at t=0, all four concentrations are c.\n\nNow, let's think about how the system will shift to reach equilibrium. The reaction can go either forward or reverse depending on whether products or reactants are favored initially.\n\nBut wait, since Kc = 24 and it's a positive number greater than 1, that suggests that at equilibrium, the concentration of products over reactants is higher than 1. So products (H2 and CO2) will be more concentrated compared to their counterparts on the left side (H2O and CO).\n\nBut initially, all concentrations are equal. Let me write down the initial setup.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n[H2O] = [CO] = c\n[H2] = [CO2] = c\n\nWait no, because H2 is a product and so is CO2; but they started with same moles as reactants? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify: the problem says equal numbers of moles for each substance are injected.\n\nSo initial concentrations:\n[H2O] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2] =",

  "Response3": "</think>\n\nTo determine the composition of the equilibrium mixture for the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g) + \\text{CO}(g) \\leftrightarrow \\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{CO}_2(g) \\]\n\nwe start by analyzing the given information. The problem states that equal moles of all four substances are injected into a rigid, sealed vessel and heated to 500 K, where \\( K_c = 24 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Write the Expression for \\( K_c \\)\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\n\\[ K_c = \\frac{[\\text{H}_2][\\text{CO}_2]}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}][\\text{CO}]} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Assume Initial Moles\nLet the initial moles of each substance be \\( n \\).

This suggests that our initial assumption of equal concentrations at equilibrium is incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Re-evaluate the Problem\nSince all substances start with equal moles but have different stoichiometric coefficients, their concentrations will change differently during the reaction.

  "Response4": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe reaction is H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g). They say that equal moles of each reactant and product are injected into a rigid vessel at 500K, where Kc is 24. I need to figure out the composition at equilibrium from the options given.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let me write down what's happening here. The reaction involves four substances: H2O, CO, H2, and CO2. All are gases in this case because it says (g). \n\nThe setup is that equal moles of each are added. That means initially, before any reactions occur, the concentrations of all four species are the same. Let's denote their initial concentration as 'c'. So [H2O] = [CO] = [H2] = [CO2] = c.\n\nWait a second\u2014no, wait. Wait, moles and concentration... but since it's a rigid vessel, volume is constant. If equal numbers of moles are injected, then the concentrations would be based on their molar amounts divided by the same volume. So yes, each initial concentration is equal to 'c'.\n\nNow, I need to consider how this reaction proceeds towards equilibrium. Let me think about the ICE table approach.\n\nInitial: [H2O] = c; [CO] = c; [H2] = 0; [CO2] = 0.\nChange: Suppose x moles react on each side. So H2O and CO decrease by x, while H2 and CO2 increase by x.\nEquilibrium: [H2O] = c - x; [CO] = c - x; [H2] = x; [CO2] = x.\n\nWait, but since all initial concentrations are the same, this simplifies things. So at equilibrium, each of H2O and CO is (c - x), while H2 and CO2 are both x.\n\nNow, Kc for the reaction is given as 24. Let me write the expression:\n\nKc = ([H2][CO2])/([H2O][CO]) \n\nSubstituting in equilibrium concentrations:\n= (x * x) / [(c - x)(c - x)]\n= x\u00b2 / (c - x)^2\n\nSo, K",

The initial moles of each substance are equal, and the system is heated to 500 K where Kc = 24.\n\n### Step 1: Write the Expression for Kc\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nKc = [H\u2082][CO\u2082] / ([H\u2082O][CO])\n\n### Step 2: Assume Initial Moles Are Equal\nLet\u2019s assume the initial moles of each gas are **n**. Thus, at the start:\n- [H\u2082O] = n\n- [CO] = n\n- [H\u2082] = 0\n- [CO\u2082] = 0\n\n### Step 3: Let x Be the Change in Moles\nAt equilibrium, let\u2019s say the change is **x**. Then:\n- [H\u2082O] decreases by x \u2192 [H\u2082O] = n - x\n- [CO] decreases by x \u2192 [CO] = n - x\n- [H\u2082] increases by x \u2192 [H\u2082] = x\n- [CO\u2082] increases by x \u2192 [CO\u2082] = x\n\n### Step 4: Substitute into Kc Expression\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations:\n\nKc = (x)(x) / [(n - x)(n - x)] = x\u00b2 / (n - x)\u00b2\n\nGiven that Kc = 24, we have:\nx\u00b2 / (n - x)\u00b2 = 24 \u2192 \u221a(x/n) = \u221a24 \u2248 4.899\n\nThis implies **x** is approximately **4.899 times n**, which means the system strongly favors products.\n\n### Step 5: Compare Concentrations\nSince x > n, [H\u2082] and [CO\u2082] are significantly larger than their reactant counterparts:\n[H\u2082O] = n - x < n\n[CO] = n - x < n\n\nThus, **[H\u2082] = [CO\u2082] > [H\u2082O] = [CO]**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct description of the equilibrium composition is:\n\n**b) [H2O] = [CO] < [H2] = [CO2]**\n\nFinal Answer: b"
