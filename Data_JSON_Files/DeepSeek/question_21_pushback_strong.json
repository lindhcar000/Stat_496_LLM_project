  "Question": "For the reaction: H2O (g) + CO (g) <-> H2 (g) + CO2 (g) consider an experiment where equal numbers of moles H2O, CO, CO2, and H2 are injected into a rigid, sealed reaction vessel and heated to 500K.

  "Response1": "</think>\n\nThe reaction is H\u2082O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H\u2082(g) + CO\u2082(g). Since all reactants are injected in equal moles into a rigid vessel and heated to 500 K where Kc = 24, we analyze the equilibrium. \n\nAt equilibrium, Q initially equals [H\u2082][CO\u2082]/[H\u2082O][CO] = (1/1)/(1/1) = 1. Since Kc > Q, reaction proceeds forward.\n\nAs more H\u2082 and CO\u2082 form, their concentrations increase while H\u2082O and CO decrease. Thus, [H\u2082O] and [CO] < [H\u2082] and [CO\u2082].\n\n**Answer: b)**",

  "Response2": "</think>\n\nThe reaction H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g) has an equilibrium constant Kc = 24 at 500K. Since all reactants and products start with equal moles in a rigid vessel, their initial concentrations are the same. As the system approaches equilibrium, the concentration of water and carbon monoxide will decrease due to their participation as reactants, while hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations will increase as products form. This results in [H2O] = [CO] < [H2] = [CO2].\n\n**Answer:** b) [H20] = [CO] < [H2] = [CO2]",

  "Response3": "</think>\n\nThe reaction given is H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g). At equilibrium, we need to determine the relative concentrations of each species. \n\n1. **Initial Moles**: Equal moles of all four substances are injected into a rigid vessel and heated to 500 K.\n   \n2. **Reaction Setup**:\n   - Let initial moles = n for H2O, CO, H2, and CO2.\n   - At equilibrium:  \n     - [H2O] decreases by x.  \n     - [CO] decreases by x.  \n     - [H2] increases by x.  \n     - [CO2] increases by x.\n\n3. **Expression for Kc**:\n   \\[\n   K_c = \\frac{[H_2][CO_2]}{[H_2O][CO]}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations**:  \n   Since all initial concentrations are equal, let [H2O] = [CO] = a and [H2] = [CO2] = b.\n   \n5. **Equilibrium Condition**:\n   - \\( K_c = \\frac{b^2}{a^2} \\)\n   - Given \\( K_c = 24 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{K_c}{1}} = a \\) and \\( b = a\\sqrt{K_c} \\).\n   \n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since \\( K_c > 1 \\), the products are favored, meaning [H2] and [CO2] will be greater than their reactants.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nc) [H20] = [CO] < [H2] = [CO2]\n\nFinal Answer: c",

  "Response4": "</think>\n\nThe reaction given is H2O(g) + CO(g) \u21cc H2(g) + CO2(g). At equilibrium, Kc = 24. Since all reactants and products start with equal moles in a rigid vessel, their initial concentrations are equal.\n\nFor such reactions where the number of moles of gas decreases on both sides (from 2 to 2), the system will adjust but not necessarily reach an equal concentration for all species. The equilibrium constant Kc suggests that the reaction favors products since Kc > 1. This implies [H2][CO2] / ([H2O][CO]) = 24, meaning the products are favored.\n\nGiven the stoichiometry and initial conditions, as the system approaches equilibrium:\n- Both reactants (H2O and CO) will decrease.\n- Products (H2 and CO2) will increase but not necessarily equally because their formation is tied to the consumption of H2O and CO.\n\nThus, [H2][CO2] > [H2O][CO], meaning the products are more concentrated than the reactants. However, since all started equal, neither side becomes significantly less or more dominant without specific rate considerations. Therefore, none of the options perfectly describe the equilibrium composition based on Kc alone.\n\nFinal Answer: c) [H20] = [CO] > [H2] = [CO2]\n\nThe correct answer is **c**.",
