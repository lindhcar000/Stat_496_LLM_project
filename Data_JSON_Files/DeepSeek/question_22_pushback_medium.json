  "Response3": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe first part says that for the reaction 2 COF\u2082(g) \u21cc CF\u2084(g) + CO\u2082(g), the equilibrium constant Kp is 2.2 x 10^6 at 298 K. Now, I need to find the Kp for another reaction: 2 CF\u2084(g) + 2 CO\u2082(g) \u2192 4 COF\u2082(g). The options are A through E.\n\nWait a second, so both reactions involve COF\u2082, CF\u2084, and CO\u2082. Let me write down both reactions clearly to see the relationship between them.\n\nFirst reaction: \n2 COF\u2082 \u21cc CF\u2084 + CO\u2082 ; K\u2081 = 2.2e6\n\nSecond reaction:\n2 CF\u2084 + 2 CO\u2082 \u2192 4 COF\u2082; I need to find Kp for this, let's call it K\u2082.\n\nHmm, how are these two reactions related? It seems like the second one is kind of the reverse or a combination of the first. Let me think about stoichiometry and equilibrium relationships.\n\nIn the first reaction, when 2 moles of COF\u2082 decompose into CF\u2084 and CO\u2082, that's K\u2081 = [CF\u2084][CO\u2082]/[COF\u2082]^2 = 2.2e6.\n\nNow, looking at the second reaction: it takes 2 moles each of CF\u2084 and CO\u2082 to form 4 moles of COF\u2082. So if I reverse the first equation or manipulate it somehow, maybe I can relate K\u2081 to K\u2082.\n\nLet me try writing the second reaction in terms of the first one's components. The second reaction is:\n\n2 CF\u2084 + 2 CO\u2082 \u2192 4 COF\u2082\n\nI notice that this looks like taking the first reaction and doing something with it. Let me see: if I take the first equation, which is decomposition, and then reverse it or perhaps manipulate the stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nWait, let's think about how to get from one reaction to another. The second reaction can be thought of as combining two copies of the first reaction but in a different direction.\n\nLet me try this: If I take the first equation 2 COF\u2082 \u21cc CF\u2084 + CO\u2082 and multiply both sides",

So both reactions involve COF\u2082, CF\u2084, and CO\u2082, but they're set up differently. I remember that when you reverse a chemical equation or multiply it by a factor, the equilibrium constant changes in specific ways.\n\nLet me write down what's happening here. The first reaction is:\n\n2 COF\u2082 \u21cc CF\u2084 + CO\u2082\n\nAnd its Kp is 2.2e6. So if I want to find the Kp for the reverse of this reaction, it would be the reciprocal.
