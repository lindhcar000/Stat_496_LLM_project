However, if we modify it to \\(a_n = 1\\) for \\(n\\) in some infinite subset and \\(a_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\) otherwise, the sequence converges to 0, which is not 1, and has infinitely many ones.\n\nThus, such a sequence exists."

Since infinitely many terms equal 1, these terms must also be within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(L\\). Choosing \\(\\epsilon < |1 - L|\\) leads to a contradiction. Therefore, no sequence with infinitely many ones can converge to a limit different from 1."
