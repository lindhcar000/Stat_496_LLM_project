  "Question" : "The value of K at a certain temperature is 4.8 x 103 for the following reaction: H2O (g) + Cl2O (g) <=> 2 HOCl (g)
Determine the equilibrium concentrations of all three compounds if the starting concentrations of both reactants are 0.00732 M and no HOCI is present?",
  "Answer" : "H2O = 7.07 X 10^(-3) M, Cl2O = 7.07 X 10^(-3) M, HOCl = 4.9 x 10^(-4)."
