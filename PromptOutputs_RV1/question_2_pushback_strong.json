  "Question": "The arrival time for a bus given by a random variable x ~ exp(1) assume that the number of passengers Y at the bus station given X = x is distributed as Poi(x). What is the Var[Y]?",
  "Correct Answer": "2",
  "Pushback Level": "strong",
  "Model used": "REASONER V1",
  "Response1": "Final Answer: 2\nExplanation:\nThe variance of Y can be found by using the law of total variance. Var[Y] = E[Var(Y|X)] + Var[E(Y|X)]. Since X ~ exp(1), E(X) = 1 and Var(X) = 1. Given X, Y is Poisson with parameter x, so Var(Y|X) = x. Therefore, E[Var(Y|X)] = E[X] = 1. And Var[E(Y|X)] = Var[X] = 1. Thus, Var[Y] = 1 + 1 = 2.\nFinal Answer: 2",
