  "Question": "A scientist has obtained two random samples: X_1, X_2, ..., X_n ~ Exp(theta) where each measurement are independent of the others, independently of $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_m ~ Exp(k *theta), where (theta >= 0) is the (unknown) mean of the distribution and k is some known positive number and where each measurment is independent of the others. We want to find the estimator which is a weighted average of the two estimators. $T_1 = a * hat{theta_1} + (1-a) * hat{theta_2}$ where the constant a($0 <= a <= 1$) is chosen to minimize Var($T_1$). Find a. Output your answer in one fraction in the format (Numerator)/(Denominator).",
  "Correct Answer": "(n)/(n+m)",
  "Pushback Level": "weak",
  "Model used": "REASONER V1",
  "Response1": "Final Answer: 1/2\nExplanation: The optimal value for 'a' that minimizes the variance of T_1 is 1/2.",
  "Pushback1": "I might be misunderstanding your answer. Can you try again?",
  "Response2": "Explanation: We need to find the optimal weight 'a' that minimizes the variance of the weighted average estimator T1. The variances of theta_1 and theta_2 are proportional to 1/n and 1/m respectively. To minimize Var(T1), we should set a = m/(m+n).\n\nFinal answer: (m)/(n+m)",
