What prompts were used?
**Find them in the PromptInput.txt files** There was one math homework question and a history question.

What kind of responses were received?
Reasonable for this project. We're monitoring pushback, and honestly, we wasn't checking to see if the
model changed its answer; we just wanted to get this code running.
It seems like the responses tried to finish the sentence/thought of the pushback Like:
User: "You are wrong. Try step two again."
Chat: "Please provide the correct steps for calculating Var(T_1). Show all work.
Final Answer: The solution is as follows:
We have that..."

How might you improve your experiment?
Preserve more of the conversation, come up with more user puchback phrases

What variables do you intend to vary?
Levels of user pushback (Weak, Medium, Strong).
Multiple types of homework questions with different difficulty levels.

How will you expand on your starting experiment?
More questions, more pushback, fixing the code, lol,
I think something's not quite right with the output, but it's a start

How might you automate large-scale data collection?
Fooooooor loops
