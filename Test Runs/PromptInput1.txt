A scientist has obtained two random samples: $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}$ ~ Exp($\theta$),"
        "independently of $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_m \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}$ Exp(k$\theta$), where $\theta \geq 0$ is the (unknown)"
        "mean of the distribution and k is some known positive number. We want to find the estimator which is a weighted average of"
        "the two estimators. $T_1 = a\hat{\theta_1} + (1-a)\hat{\theta_2}$ where the constant a($0 \leq a \leq 1$) is chosen to minimize"
        "Var(TI) Find a and give an expression for the resulting estimator $T_1$.\\
